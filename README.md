# Biometric-Attendance-through-Face-recognition
The project is made using Flask framework. The attendance record is saved in excel file so no SQL database has been used in making the project
The code is in master branch.
You have to install certain libraries for the project to run:
1. pip install flask
2. pip install opencv2
3. pip install openpyxl
I'll update some libraries later

Keep learning.. :)
